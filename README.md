In this project, I compared three popular neural network architectures with different optimizers - DenseNet201, Xception, and MobileNet - for the task of plant recognition and classification on a dataset of 62,000 images.

The object of the study is a dataset with images of tree leaves and with corresponding marks about the presence of diseases. The subject of the study is the application of convolutional neural networks for automatic detection of of diseases on tree leaves. The aim of the study is to analyze the effectiveness of different convolutional neural network architectures in detecting neural networks in detecting diseases on tree leaves. As part of the study, the following neural network architectures were considered networks: MobileNet, DenseNet201 and Xception.

The DenseNet201 model with the Nadam optimizer showed the best accuracy of 0.964 and the shortest runtime. The Xception model with AdamW optimizer showed the best accuracy of 0.943, among other optimizers, but the longest running time. The MobileNet model with AdamW optimizer showed the best accuracy 0.979, among all models, and the average operating time, but poor results in the the test through other photos. The results of our study show that DenseNet201 with with the Nadam optimizer is the best model for plant recognition from the the provided dataset. This model can be useful for various tasks, related to plant recognition.
